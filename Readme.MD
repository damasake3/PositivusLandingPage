# Positivus Landing Page (Blazor Implementation)
This project is my **practice implementation** of the free [Positivus Landing Page](https://www.figma.com/community/file/xxxxx) design from Figma Community.  
My goal is to practice **modular Blazor components** and **frontend layout techniques** (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap).

## Credits
Design inspired by the free [Positivus Landing Page](https://www.figma.com/community/file/xxxxx) Figma Community design.
I do not own the original design; this is purely for **educational and practice purposes**.
